	is a great variety of neuronal morphologies and thus no prototypical
	nerve cell. Considering all the different shapes and sizes of motor
	neurons, sensory or autonomic ganglion cells, , Purkinje cells,
	granule cells, cortical interneurons or pyramidal cells, it is
	astonishing that they are all built for the same purpose: to
	receive, process and transmit information by means of bioelectrical
	signals. Neurons share all the features of basic metabolism,
	cytoarchitecture, organelles and functional cell biology with other
	somatic cells. The usually spherical nucleus shows relatively little
	heterochromatin and contains one or even two nucleoli. There are
	mitochondria, lysosomes, Golgi complexes and a rough endoplasmic
	reticulum (RER) organized in Nissl bodies. Neurons possess an
	especially elaborate cytoskeleton with microtubules, intermediate
	filaments and microfilaments used as scaffolds or motors to manage
	the enormous task of cytoplasmic transport in the axons and the
	dendrites. This reflects the need to support the unique morphology
	of neurons which are asymmetrical and polarized to an extent not
	seen in any other cell. A sophisticated transport system is needed
	to supply the axon, which does not have any protein synthesis of its
	own, and the dendrites. The great variety of molecules needed to
	sustain information processing at the synapse and along the neuronal
	membranes may be the reason for another outstanding feature of the
	nerve cell: the great variety of genes transcribed in neurons. </font>

	is important to realize that neurons change under pathological
	conditions. This has been investigated most extensively in the motor
	neurons of the spinal cord and the brainstem after axotomy. Much
	knowledge on the plasticity of regulatory mechanisms in injured
	neurons has been gained through studies of the nerve cell body&rsquo;s
	response to axonal lesions.</b></font></p>
